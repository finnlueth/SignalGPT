# SignalGPT

## Abstract

SignalGPT aims to enhance the prediction of signal peptides by using large language models, specifically focusing on the Low-Rank Adaptation technique to efficiently fine-tune an array of domain expert pre-trained model adapters.
It matches the performance of previous methods while being lightweight and inexpensive to train.
